Verification tasks from Linux kernel 3.14.
Tasks were taken for five rule specifications: linux-alloc-spinlock, linux-drivers-clk1, linux-kernel-locking-mutex, linux-kernel-locking-spinlock, linux-usb-dev.
Tasks marked with complex_emg contain default environment model, the others have simplified model.
