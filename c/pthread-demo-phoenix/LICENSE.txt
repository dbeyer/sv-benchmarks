We have created a mailing list for Phoenix users (phoenix-users@lists.stanford.edu). The goal is to provide a forum to communicate issues / fixes and exchange ideas about Phoenix and MapReduce programming in general. To receive the messages, please register. The messages are also archived. Note that the existence of the mailing list does not come along with support guarantees...
