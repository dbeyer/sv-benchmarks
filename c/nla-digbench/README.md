The benchmarks in this directory were submitted by 
ThanhVu Nguyen (tnguyen@cse.unl.edu) and 
Timos Antonopoulos (timos.antonopoulos@yale.edu).
These programs contain nonlinear polynomial (equality) properities
that are challenging for program analysis.
They were collected from various sources and 
have been used in the DIG (Dynamic Invariant Generation) work:
